it is a far, far better thing that i do, than i have ever done
it never rains but it pours
it stands to reason
it takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it home
it takes a thief to catch a thief
it takes all sorts
it takes getting used to
it takes one to know one
it takes two to tango

it was the best of times, it was the worst of times

it's no use
it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game
it's to die
it's to laugh
it's your funeral
